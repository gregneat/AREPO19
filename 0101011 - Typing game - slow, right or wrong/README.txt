Lab Goal: Create a simple typing game where the user either gets the typed phrase exactly correct or its wrong if there is at least 
one error.  A previously defined sentence should be displayed character by character
on the Canvas trailing behind the moving Car.  The user types their answer in the
cmd window as the sentence is revealed on the Canvas.  When the user hits enter, the user is
notified on the Canvas whether their input matches the sentence (i.e.,they typed it correctly) or not.
